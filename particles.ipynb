    "Add the planet Jupiter (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter)) to your small planetary system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2:\n",
    "Your planetary system is notoriously planar, and initialy the earth and moon are positioned along the Cartesian x-axis with the velocity vector in the Cartesian y-direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make the Sun-Earth-Moon system more realistic by introducing a small inclination to the Earth's and Moon's orbits and by giving them a random mean anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Orbital element module](https://github.com/amusecode/amuse/blob/main/src/amuse/ext/orbital_elements.py) of AMUSE could come in handy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3:\n",
    "Calculate the total  gravitational binding energy of solarsystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now displace the entire particle set by 100 parsec and give it a linear velocity of 100km/s in the z-direction.\n",
    "Then calculate the binding energy of the system again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did the binding energy of the Solar system change by this translation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1:\n",
    "Particle sets have the attribute *get_binaries()*.\n",
    "If you use this function to check the binaries in your system you will find that (without Jupiter) you have 3 binaries. Explain why the Sun is in a binary with the Moon. You may want to take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/amusecode/amuse/blob/main/src/amuse/datamodel/particle_attributes.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4:\n",
    "Generate another particle set with a 2 solar-mass star and two planets of 10 and 100 Earth masses in cirular orbits at 0.1 and 0.6 au. Place this second planetary system at apocenter around your Solar system (true anomaly of 180 degrees) at a semimajor axis of 60 au with an eccentricity of 0.6.\n",
    "Then move the entire system to the center of mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2:\n",
    "Which of the orbits of the binary star with planets from *Assignment 4* has the highest binding energy?"
