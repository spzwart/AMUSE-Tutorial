# AMUSE-Tutorial

Here are a number of small AMUSE tutorials in the form of python
notebooks.  These tutorial will (in part) be used for the lecture
series on Simulation and Modeling in astrophysics at Leiden
Observatory of Leiden University, year 2023 September to December.

Further course information can be found at the
[wiki](https://github.com/spzwart/AMUSE-Tutorial/wiki)

Responsibility --so-far-- is by Simon Portegies Zwart
But anybody who would like to contribute is welcome.

The course is composed of 12 lectures with an equal number of
assignments.

##  running_Nbody_with_collisions.ipynb
Perform an N-body calculation that includes stellar evolution and
collisions between stars.

#### Learning objectives
 * Channels
 * Generate initial conditions.
 * Initialize stellar and N-body codes.
 * More advanced channels for copying specific attributes.
 * Sstopping conditions.
 * Initiate collision detection.
 * Find a specific particle in another particle set.

##  bridged_Nbody_with_Galaxy.ipynb   
Simulate a single star (and a cluster) in orbit around the Galactic
center.

#### Learning objectives
 * Single-directional hierarchical code coupling strategy (i.e. classice bridge).
 * Bridge timesteps.
 * Constructing classes in Python
 * Incorporating an external potential to an N-body simulation
 * Appreciate the role of get_gravity_at_point function in bridge.

##  gravity_cascaded_bridges.ipynb
Simulate several planetary system, each with their own N-body
integrator, and the lot integrated in another N-body code.  Note that
here the interactions of one planet to the planets around another star
are ignored in this implementation.

#### Learning objectives
 * use a cascade of bridges

## high_order_bridge.ipynb
**Not yet documented**
**Not yet working**
You simulate a debris disk around a moon, in orbit around a planet, in
orbit around a star. This requires a higher order bridge, in order to
assure that the orbital integration is performed with sufficient
precision and accuracy.

#### Learning objectives
 * Initialize a two-way bridge
 * High-order bridge initalization
 * How to construct a disk around a celestial body.

## hierachical_bridges.ipynb
**Not yet documented**
Construct a hierarchial bridge to integrate a highly hierarchical
system of star and planets.

#### Learning objectives
 * Non-linear coupling strategies (bridge).
 * Hierarchical coupling strategies (bridge).
 * Multiple channels to single particle set.

##  running_hydrodynamics.ipynb
Evolve a massive single star up to the moment it explodes in a
supernova. After this we inject energy into the inner-region of the
star and follow the hydrodynamics of the explosion by means of a
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code. 

#### Learning objectives
 * Run another AMUSE module to generate initial conditions for yet another code.
 * How to recove the crash of a code and pick-up the result.
 * Store simulation data in the form if python pickel files, and recover from those.
 * plot the result of a hydrodynamical simulation.
 * make an animation of simulation results.
 * Run an AMUSE module as a parallel job.

## bridge_gravity_with_hydro.ipynb

## evolve_stars_asynchroneously.ipynb
 * learn how to construct a population of stars that did not co-evolve

## running_radiative_transport.ipynb
**Not yet constructed**
